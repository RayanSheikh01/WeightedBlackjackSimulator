    "# Blackjack Simulator: Cheating Dealer Edition 🎲🃏\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is an interactive **Blackjack game simulator** designed to explore probabilities, strategies and the impact of a **weighted (cheating) dealer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The project simulates rounds of Blackjack between a player and a dealer, implementing standard Blackjack rules:\n",
    "- Cards 2–10 are valued at their number  \n",
    "- J, Q, K = 10  \n",
    "- Ace = 1 or 11 (whichever benefits the hand)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dealer uses a **weighted deck**, increasing the likelihood of drawing high value cards, giving them an advantage over the player. This allows for analysis of how “cheating” affects game outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- Simulate **single or multiple rounds** of Blackjack  \n",
    "- Track **player and dealer hand totals** and round outcomes  \n",
    "- Compare results with a **normal dealer vs. cheating dealer**  \n",
    "- Generate **visualisations**: bar charts, histograms, and cumulative win rates  \n",
    "- Explore **probabilities, expected values, and game strategies**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a combination of **game simulation, probability analysis, and data visualisation**, demonstrating Python programming and interactive notebook design.\n"
